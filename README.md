BulkVideoTrimmer is a quick and dirty software for trimming and compressing video files made in Unity for Windows, macOS and Linux. 

This software is being made as a utility for me first, please don't question my choices. I'm a noob and don't have a lot of time to build something super polished.

PS: I'm open to PRs and sugestions, just don't expect me to port the app to another framework like Avalonia, Flutter, etc or use another ffmpeg lib.

## Building
Install Unity 6000.0.46f1 and well... build it the same way as any other unity project

## Thirdparty software
- Unity Engine (https://unity.com)
- NuGetForUnity (https://github.com/GlitchEnzo/NuGetForUnity)
- FFMpegCore (https://github.com/rosenbjerg/FFMpegCore)
